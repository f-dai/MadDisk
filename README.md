# MadDisk

You are now a disk. So many IO requests are incoming! Can you handle them efficiently?

## Play
https://jamesjaw.github.io/maddisk.github.io/

## Development
To run the project, clone the repository, cd into it, and
```bash
python3 -m http.server
```
You will see something like `Serving HTTP on :: port 8000 (http://[::]:8000/)`, then open http://localhost:8000/index.html for local test server. If you see another port number, just change it in the url.
